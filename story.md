# Story

### PROBLEM

Visiting National Parks can be fun as you explore places you have never been before and may not have known existed around you, but planning a trip may seem overwhelming.  So, you turn to the National Park Service (NPS) website.  After opening the home page, you see a link in the dropdown menu to Plan Your Visit.  Perfect!  The page suggests you Find a Park, so you click that link.  You are prompted to select a state, and you question what state to click.  You live in Illinois, but are very close to Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin.  Some places in those states are even closer than the southern tip of Illinois.  You’d rather just know what’s around you.  So you decide to select all the states that are close to you, but the page redirects after the first state you click.  Frustrated, you close the website and decide to try to plan with another website tomorrow.

### SOLUTION

The next day, you Google search for a different solution.  You open a few links that appear at the top of the page and decide to try them out.  Many of them provide information for trip planning or pre planned routes, but do not provide personalization.  Until you find “National Park Finder”.  This system will allow you to geographically search for national parks in your area, or any location you input.  You also select a radius to determine how far you are interested in traveling.  A search then returns all national parks in the area. You can also filter by Activities and Topics which are specific qualities of the parks.  The results are displayed on a map below.  There are location pins on the map centered around your location that correspond to a detailed list of results further below.  The list is organized closest to your location.  Using the map and the list, you browse parks and decide which ones you would like to visit.

### WHEN THEY LEAVE

You feel relieved because the search results are actually customized to you and your needs.  You know this website is reputable because they state they use the NPS API and the Google Maps API, and now that you have decided which parks you would like to visit, you can confidently use this information to coordinate your transportation, lodging, and other activities on another site.
